# Computer Architecture (Just some personal notes)

Bit is the smallest unit of information inside computer world, other units are byte, kilobyte, megabyte, gigabyte, etc.

Disk storage: HDD, SSD, etc.
- HDD: Hard Disk Drive, it is a mechanical device that uses a spinning disk to store data.
- SSD: Solid State Drive, it is a solid-state storage device that uses flash memory to store data.

RAM: Random Access Memory, it is a volatile memory (after start up computer, the data is lost) that stores data that is being processed.
- RAM explains the data structure, variables and application data

CPU: Central Processing Unit, it is the brain of the computer.
- CPU explains the logic of the program, the control flow of the program, the data flow of the program.

Cache: Cache is a small amount of memory that is used to store frequently used data.
- Cache is used to speed up the access of data.

## Quick summary
- CPU is the brain of the computer, it is responsible for executing the instructions of the program.
- RAM is the memory of the computer, it is responsible for storing the data that is being processed.
- Disk storage is the storage of the computer, it is responsible for storing the data that is not being processed.
- Cache is the small amount of memory that is used to speed up the access of data.

* The code we write will be complied as machine code, which is a sequence of 0 and 1 and CPU can understand it and execute it.
